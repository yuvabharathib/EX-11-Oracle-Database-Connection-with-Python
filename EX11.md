# EX 11: Oracle Database Connection with Python
## Date: 
## AIM:
To connect Oracle database with Python using cx_Oracle module.
## PROCEDURE:
1. Install cx-Oracle : With the command **pip install cx-Oracle**
2. To Connect **connect():**
   Now Establish a connection between the Python program and Oracle database by using connect() function. 
```python
con = cx_Oracle.connect('username/password@localhost')
cursor(): To execute a SQL query and to provide results some special object is required that is nothing but cursor() object.
cursor = con.cursor()
```
3.To Execute **execute/executemany method:**
```python
cursor.execute(sqlquery) - - - -> to execute a single query. 
cursor.executemany(sqlqueries) - - - -> to execute a single query with multiple bind variables/place holders.
```
4. To Commit **commit():**
   For DML(Data Manipulation Language) queries that comprise operations like update, insert, delete. We need to commit() then only the result reflects in the database.
5. To Fetch rows: **fetchone(), fetchmany(int), fetchall():**
fetchone() : This method is used to fetch one single row from the top of the result set.
fetchmany(int): This method is used to fetch a limited number of rows based on the argument passed in it.
fetchall() : This method is used to fetch all rows from the result set.
6. To Close db connectivity **close():**
   After all done it is mandatory to close all operations.
```python
cursor.close()
con.close()
```
## PROGRAM:
```python
# importing module
import cx_Oracle

# Create a table in Oracle database
try:
	con = cx_Oracle.connect('tiger/scott@localhost:1521/xe')
	print(con.version)
	# Now execute the sqlquery
	cursor = con.cursor()
	# Creating a table employee
	cursor.execute(
		"create table employee(empid integer primary key, name varchar2(30), salary number(10, 2))")
	print("Table Created successfully")
except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError as e:
	print("There is a problem with Oracle", e)
# by writing finally if any error occurs
# then also we can close the all database operation
finally:
	if cursor:
		cursor.close()
	if con:
		con.close()
```

## PROGRAM:
```python
import cx_Oracle
# Load data from a csv file into Oracle table using executemany
try:
	con = cx_Oracle.connect('tiger/scott@localhost:1521/xe')
except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError as er:
	print('There is an error in Oracle database:', er)
else:
	try:
		cur = con.cursor()
		data = [[10007, 'Vikram', 48000.0], [10008, 'Sunil', 65000.1], [10009, 'Sameer', 75000.0]]
		cur = con.cursor()
		# Inserting multiple records into employee table
		# (:1,:2,:3) are place holders. They pick data from a list supplied as argument
		cur.executemany('insert into employee values(:1,:2,:3)', data)
	except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError as er:
		print('There is an error in Oracle database:', er)
	except Exception as er:
		print(er)
	else:
		# To commit the transaction manually
		con.commit()
		print('Multiple records are inserted successfully')
finally:
	if cur:
		cur.close()
	if con:
		con.close()
```

## PROGRAM:
```python
import cx_Oracle
try:
	con = cx_Oracle.connect('tiger/scott@localhost:1521/xe')
except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError as er:
	print('There is error in the Oracle database:', er)
else:
	try:
		cur = con.cursor()
		cur.execute('select * from employee where salary > :sal', {'sal': 50000})
		rows = cur.fetchall()
		print(rows)
	except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError as er:
		print('There is error in the Oracle database:', er)
	except Exception as er:
		print('Error:', er)
	finally:
		if cur:
			cur.close()
finally:
	if con:
		con.close()
```

## RESULT:
Thus the program for dababase connectivity with python has been executed successfully.
